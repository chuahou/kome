kome
====

A simple osu! skin for personal use.

Cloning
-------

To clone on Windows, make sure to run

	git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/chuahou/kome.git

instead of

	git clone https://github.com/chuahou/kome.git

in order to maintain symlinks.

Packaging
---------

Due to the use of symlinks (probably), osu! cannot export this as an osk file.
Manually create this archive by compressing it into a zip archive and renaming
the extension to osk.
